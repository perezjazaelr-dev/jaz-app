  description: `I'm a full-stack developer with a passion for creating beautiful, performant web applications. With experience in modern JavaScript frameworks and a strong foundation in computer science, I bring technical expertise and creative problem-solving to every project.

My journey in software development began with a curiosity about how things work under the hood, which led me to pursue formal education and hands-on experience in the field. Today, I specialize in building responsive, accessible, and user-friendly applications that solve real-world problems.

I believe in writing clean, maintainable code and staying current with industry best practices. When I'm not coding, you can find me contributing to open-source projects, learning new technologies, or sharing knowledge with the developer community.`,
